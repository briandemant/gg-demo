```
The Ides here is to see how far we can take this Utility-first css pattern
You can read more about tyailwinds here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind
I think its really cool.

Look through the larger components/pages and see how much you can extract into smaller components.
I left some of them bigger deliberately, but i'd like a second opinion
```

```
npm install           # to install dependencies
npm run build-tails   #to build your tailwind css
npm run start-graphql #This will start the graphql server
npm run dev           # to compile TypeScript files and to run next.js  (localhost:3003)
PORT=3030 npm run dev # ^ same but on port 3030


```
